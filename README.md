![alt text](Documents/gameStart.png "Starting the game")

1. At first you can choose which track you wanna play (but watch out, the amount of cars on the track indicates the amount of players!)
2. The track we chose (challenge.txt) has two Cars on it - this means we get two choose the move strategy for Player 1...
3. ... and Player 2 (Increases logically with every Car more on the track)! 

![alt text](Documents/trackAndFirstMove.png "Making a move")

1. After choosing your track and move strategy, the track gets printed...
2. ... and Player 1 can make his first move - the characters ```qwe asd yxc``` 
stand for the nine possible vectors in front of a Players Car one can choose to make a move (for a more detailed explanation see the ```j``` command in the game to see the ```help```).


* This goes on, Player after Player, until either just one Car is remaining on the track or a Car has reached the finish line. 
* There is also a ```k``` command to ```restart```... 
* ...and a ```l``` commmand to ```quit``` end the game.
